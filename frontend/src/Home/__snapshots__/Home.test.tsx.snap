        COVA/ANGEL Visualization
      </h1>
      <p>
        Dimensionality reduction for cohort data visualization is to plot a high-dimensional dataset in 2D,3D spaces to help analysts identify data properties and gain insights visually. COVA and ANGEL are two novel data visualization algorithms that provide a simple but effective way to improve cohort data visualization performance comprehensively. This demo website illustrates examples embedded by these two algorithms under different hyper-parameter settings and supports users in visualizing their datasets. In addition, the fast-ANGEL version is applied to the users' custom datasets. The current restriction of input data format is '.mat'.
